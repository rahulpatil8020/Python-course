Before looking at programming language let's just remind what **Language** is?
**Language** is simply a medium of communication between us _humans_. Similarly a **Programming Language** is a medium of communication between _humans_ and _computers_.
Computers understand only **0's** and **1's** which is called `Machine Level Language`. we humans don't understand it so we have developed some languages which will work as translator between us and computers and those languages are `Programming Languages`.

# Why to Learn Programming?

**Programming** is not for Software Engineers only, it is for `EVERYONE`. It is not about landing job in IT field. It is about improving our problem solving skills and logical thinking. **Programming** does improve the way we look at problems in our lives. Thus everyone should learn Programming.

# Why Python?

As shown in the chart above, **python** is the most famous programmming language and it is also one of the easiest language for beginners. Python has so many _pre-defined libraries_ to help beginners find their way in solving problems. There is no doubt that python is one of the best language to learn and to master.

# Basics

Before taking a deep dive into python we shall discuss some of the basic concepts that are necessary for learning any programming language.

**1. Data**
`What is data?` This is the most important question every programmer should know the answer of. Data are characteristics or information, usually numerical, that are collected through observation. In a Nutshell, **Data is nothing but all the information around us**.

**2. Operations**
There are 3 types of Operations used in programming.

- Arithmetic Operations
- Relational Operations
- Logical Operations
